Usage:

    1) Install dependencies with the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
    2) Run the application with the command: python application.py
       Optional parameter --port can be used to specify the port to run on.
       Otherwise it'll run on port 9876, as pictured on assignment.txt
       
    3) If the application is intended to run on a different web server than Flask's 
    integrated one (ie: gunicorn, nginx), the WSGI application can be accessed via application:app

    
Notes:

    * No testing code was included, to stick to assignment requirements.
    * The code wasn't wrapped with proper packaging, to stick to assignment
    requirements.
    * The code is able to run on Python2 and Python3
